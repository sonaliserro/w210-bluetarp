## Welcome to Project BlueTarp!

Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and over $635M of Housing Assistance aid has been provided by FEMA in response. Project BlueTarp uses supervised Machine Learning to evaluate the extent to which the island received an equitable allocation of aid, through a comparison with Florida and Texas, also impacted by hurricanes that year. The intent behind this research is to inform policy decisions that advocate for an effective and equitable recovery process.
